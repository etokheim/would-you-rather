# Would you rather

A game of would you rather questions made with React and Redux.

Answer daring questions of what you'd rather. You must answer the questions or risk sitting on the bottom of the leaderboard. Your score increase for every answered question, but you'll get even more points for asking new questions. Have fun!


## Development environment

To get the app up and running for development environments you need to have `git`, `nodejs`, `yarn` and `npm` installed.

When you are ready, follow the instructions to start the app:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [url]
   ```
   - You can get the url from the top right corner (`Clone or download ðŸ”½`)
2. Navigate into the cloned project:
   ```sh
   cd would-you-rather
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
   - This can take a minute or two depending on your network connection
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
   - This can also take a minute or two
